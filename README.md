# Bravo Company - Zero Army
The Zero Army's Bravo Company collection contains 200 ON-CHAIN dynamic NFTs (AKA: dNFTs) with burnable soulbound $AIM0 tokens. Owners can change select text. The colors and patterns change every time a user clicks the "Refresh metadata" button on Opensea. The rank, rewards and crypto-currency token supply also change over time as players engage with the token.These 200 NFTs serve as tickets to a unique metaverse experience within the World War Zero Army metaverse - codenamed: the MetaSERVE. 

Holders of Bravo Company tokens will take up unique positions along the Zero Army's FRONTLINE within the MetaSERVE simulation game. Zero Army Bravo Company Commandos (AKA: C0s) must win back control of the FRONTLINE using strategic thinking and economic AIMunition - $AIM0. Firing their burnable $AIM0 tokens, Bravo Company C0s must burn the entire 2 Million ROUND supply to complete their mission. 

REWARDS: 
1. For every ATTO-ROUND of $AIM0 that is burned an equal supply of ATTO-Z3R0 Mission Coins is earned!
2. When a C0 burns through 100 ROUNDS of $AIM0, their Bravo Company NFT will rank up by 1 degree.
